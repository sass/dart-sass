## 1.4.0

### Command-Line Interface

* Add support for compiling multiple files at once by writing
  `sass input.scss:output.css`. Note that unlike Ruby Sass, this *always*
  compiles files by default regardless of when they were modified.

  This syntax also supports compiling entire directories at once. For example,
  `sass templates/stylesheets:public/css` compiles all non-partial Sass files
  in `templates/stylesheets` to CSS files in `public/css`.

## 1.3.2

* Add support for `@elseif` as an alias of `@else if`. This is not an
  intentional feature, so using it will cause a deprecation warning. It will be
  removed at some point in the future.

## 1.3.1

### Node API

* Fix loading imports relative to stylesheets that were themselves imported
  though relative include paths.

## 1.3.0

### Command-Line Interface

* Generate source map files by default when writing to disk. This can be
  disabled by passing `--no-source-map`.

* Add a `--source-map-urls` option to control whether the source file URLs in
  the generated source map are relative or absolute.

* Add an `--embed-sources` option to embed the contents of all source files in
  the generated source map.

* Add an `--embed-source-map` option to embed the generated source map as a
  `data:` URL in the generated CSS.

### Dart API

* Add a `sourceMap` parameter to `compile()`, `compileString()`,
  `compileAsync()`, and `compileStringAsync()`. This takes a callback that's
  called with a [`SingleMapping`][] that contains the source map information for
  the compiled CSS file.

[`SingleMapping`]: https://www.dartdocs.org/documentation/source_maps/latest/source_maps.parser/SingleMapping-class.html

### Node API

* Added support for the `sourceMap`, `omitSourceMapUrl`, `outFile`,
  `sourceMapContents`, `sourceMapEmbed`, and `sourceMapRoot` options to
  `render()` and `renderSync()`.

* Fix a bug where passing a relative path to `render()` or `renderSync()` would
  cause relative imports to break.

* Fix a crash when printing warnings in stylesheets compiled using `render()` or
  `renderSync()`.

* Fix a bug where format errors were reported badly on Windows.

## 1.2.1

* Always emit units in compressed mode for `0` dimensions other than lengths and
  angles.

## 1.2.0

* The command-line executable will now create the directory for the resulting
  CSS if that directory doesn't exist.

* Properly parse `#{$var} -#{$var}` as two separate values in a list rather than
  one value being subtracted from another.

* Improve the error message for extending compound selectors.

## 1.1.1

* Add a commit that was accidentally left out of 1.1.0.

## 1.1.0

* The command-line executable can now be used to write an output file to disk
  using `sass input.scss output.css`.

* Use a POSIX-shell-compatible means of finding the location of the `sass` shell
  script.

## 1.0.0

**Initial stable release.**

### Changes Since 1.0.0-rc.1

* Allow `!` in custom property values ([#260][]).

[#260]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/260

#### Dart API

* Remove the deprecated `render()` function.

#### Node API

* Errors are now subtypes of the `Error` type.

* Allow both the `data` and `file` options to be passed to `render()` and
  `renderSync()` at once. The `data` option will be used as the contents of the
  stylesheet, and the `file` option will be used as the path for error reporting
  and relative imports. This matches Node Sass's behavior.

## 1.0.0-rc.1

* Add support for importing an `_index.scss` or `_index.sass` file when
  importing a directory.

* Add a `--load-path` command-line option (alias `-I`) for passing additional
  paths to search for Sass files to import.

* Add a `--quiet` command-line option (alias `-q`) for silencing warnings.

* Add an `--indented` command-line option for using the indented syntax with a
  stylesheet from standard input.

* Don't merge the media queries `not type` and `(feature)`. We had previously
  been generating `not type and (feature)`, but that's not actually the
  intersection of the two queries.

* Don't crash on `$x % 0`.

* The standalone executable distributed on GitHub is now named `sass` rather
  than `dart-sass`. The `dart-sass` executable will remain, with a deprecation
  message, until 1.0.0 is released.

### Dart API

* Add a `Logger` class that allows users to control how messages are printed by
  stylesheets.

* Add a `logger` parameter to `compile()`, `compileAsync()`, `compileString()`,
  and `compileStringAsync()`.

### Node JS API

* Import URLs passed to importers are no longer normalized. For example, if a
  stylesheet contains `@import "./foo.scss"`, importers will now receive
  `"./foo.scss"` rather than `"foo.scss"`.

## 1.0.0-beta.5.3

* Support hard tabs in the indented syntax.

* Improve the formatting of comments that don't start on the same line as the
  opening `/*`.

* Preserve whitespace after `and` in media queries in compressed mode.

### Indented Syntax

* Properly parse multi-line selectors.

* Don't deadlock on `/*` comments.

* Don't add an extra `*/` to comments that already have it.

* Preserve empty lines in `/*` comments.

## 1.0.0-beta.5.2

* Fix a bug where some colors would crash `compressed` mode.

## 1.0.0-beta.5.1

* Add a `compressed` output style.

* Emit a warning when `&&` is used, since it's probably not what the user means.

* `round()` now returns the correct results for negative numbers that should
  round down.

* `var()` may now be passed in place of multiple arguments to `rgb()`, `rgba()`,
  `hsl()` and `hsla()`.

* Fix some cases where equivalent numbers wouldn't count as the same keys in
  maps.

* Fix a bug where multiplication like `(1/1px) * (1px/1)` wouldn't properly
  cancel out units.

* Fix a bug where dividing by a compatible unit would produce an invalid
  result.

* Remove a non-`sh`-compatible idiom from the standalone shell script.

### Dart API

* Add a `functions` parameter to `compile()`, `compleString()`,
  `compileAsync()`, and `compileStringAsync()`. This allows users to define
  custom functions in Dart that can be invoked from Sass stylesheets.

* Expose the `Callable` and `AsyncCallable` types, which represent functions
  that can be invoked from Sass.

* Expose the `Value` type and its subclasses, as well as the top-level
  `sassTrue`, `sassFalse`, and `sassNull` values, which represent Sass values
  that may be passed into or returned from custom functions.

* Expose the `OutputStyle` enum, and add a `style` parameter to `compile()`,
  `compleString()`, `compileAsync()`, and `compileStringAsync()` that allows
  users to control the output style.

### Node JS API

* Support the `functions` option.

* Support the `"compressed"` value for the `outputStyle` option.

## 1.0.0-beta.4

* Support unquoted imports in the indented syntax.

* Fix a crash when `:not(...)` extends a selector that appears in
  `:not(:not(...))`.

### Node JS API

* Add support for asynchronous importers to `render()` and `renderSync()`.

### Dart API

* Add `compileAsync()` and `compileStringAsync()` methods. These run
  asynchronously, which allows them to take asynchronous importers (see below).

* Add an `AsyncImporter` class. This allows imports to be resolved
  asynchronously in case no synchronous APIs are available. `AsyncImporter`s are
  only compatible with `compileAysnc()` and `compileStringAsync()`.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

* Properly parse numbers with exponents.

* Don't crash when evaluating CSS variables whose names are entirely
  interpolated (for example, `#{--foo}: ...`).

### Node JS API

* Add support for the `importer` option to `render()` and `renderSync()`.
  Only synchronous importers are currently supported.

### Dart API

* Added an `Importer` class. This can be extended by users to provide support
  for custom resolution for `@import` rules.

* Added built-in `FilesystemImporter` and `PackageImporter` implementations that
  support resolving `file:` and `package:` URLs, respectively.

* Added an `importers` argument to the `compile()` and `compileString()`
  functions that provides `Importer`s to use when resolving `@import` rules.

* Added a `loadPaths` argument to the `compile()` and `compileString()`
  functions that provides paths to search for stylesheets when resolving
  `@import` rules. This is a shorthand for passing `FilesystemImporter`s to the
  `importers` argument.

## 1.0.0-beta.2

* Add support for the `::slotted()` pseudo-element.

* Generated transparent colors will now be emitted as `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` rather
  than `transparent`. This works around a bug wherein IE incorrectly handles the
  latter format.

### Command-Line Interface

* Improve the logic for whether to use terminal colors by default.

### Node JS API

* Add support for `data`, `includePaths`, `indentedSyntax`, `lineFeed`,
  `indentWidth`, and `indentType` options to `render()` and `renderSync()`.

* The result object returned by `render()` and `renderSync()` now includes the
  `stats` object which provides metadata about the compilation process.

* The error object thrown by `render()` and `renderSync()` now includes `line`,
  `column`, `file`, `status`, and `formatted` fields. The `message` field and
  `toString()` also provide more information.

### Dart API

* Add a `renderString()` method for rendering Sass source that's not in a file
  on disk.

## 1.0.0-beta.1

* Drop support for the reference combinator. This has been removed from the
  spec, and will be deprecated and eventually removed in other implementations.

* Trust type annotations when compiling to JavaScript, which makes it
  substantially faster.

* Compile to minified JavaScript, which decreases the code size substantially
  and makes startup a little faster.

* Fix a crash when inspecting a string expression that ended in "\a".

* Fix a bug where declarations and `@extend` were allowed outside of a style
  rule in certain circumstances.

* Fix `not` in parentheses in `@supports` conditions.

* Allow `url` as an identifier name.

* Properly parse `/***/` in selectors.

* Properly parse unary operators immediately after commas.

* Match Ruby Sass's rounding behavior for all functions.

* Allow `\` at the beginning of a selector in the indented syntax.

* Fix a number of `@extend` bugs:

  * `selector-extend()` and `selector-replace()` now allow compound selector
    extendees.

  * Remove the universal selector `*` when unifying with other selectors.

  * Properly unify the result of multiple simple selectors in the same compound
    selector being extended.

  * Properly handle extensions being extended.

  * Properly follow the [first law of `@extend`][laws].

  * Fix selector specificity tracking to follow the
    [second law of `@extend`][laws].

  * Allow extensions that match selectors but fail to unify.

  * Partially-extended selectors are no longer used as parent selectors.

  * Fix an edge case where both the extender and the extended selector
    have invalid combinator sequences.

  * Don't crash with a "Bad state: no element" error in certain edge cases.

[laws]: https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/324#issuecomment-4607184

## 1.0.0-alpha.9

* Elements without a namespace (such as `div`) are no longer unified with
  elements with the empty namespace (such as `|div`). This unification didn't
  match the results returned by `is-superselector()`, and was not guaranteed to
  be valid.

  lexical scope rather than always using the global scope.

* `str-index()` now correctly inserts at negative indices.

* Properly parse `url()`s that contain comment-like text.

  circumstances.

* Properly handle `@for` rules where each bound has a different unit.

* Forbid mixins and functions from being defined in control directives.

* Fix a superselector-computation edge case involving `:not()`.

* Gracefully handle input files that are invalid UTF-8.

* Print a Sass stack trace when a file fails to load.

## 1.0.0-alpha.6

* Allow `var()` to be passed to `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, and `hsla()`.

* Fix conversions between numbers with `dpi`, `dpcm`, and `dppx` units.
  Previously these conversions were inverted.

* Don't crash when calling `str-slice()` with an `$end-at` index lower than the
  `$start-at` index.

* `str-slice()` now correctly returns `""` when `$end-at` is negative and points
  before the beginning of the string.

* Interpolation in quoted strings now properly preserves newlines.

* Don't crash when passing only `$hue` or no keyword arguments to
  `adjust-color()`, `scale-color()`, or `change-color()`.
