# We could depend on sass_analysis with a path dependency and include
# package:sass_analysis/analysis_options.yaml, but path dependencies don't play
# nicely with the logic we use to determine whether generated files are
# out-of-date (because they cause "pub run" to modify the lockfile before it
# runs the executable).
