# @sass/types

This package is a dual-publish of the [Sass JS API](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/)
types. The `sass` and `sass-embedded` packages **still contain types**. This package is for
users who _only_ need the Sass JS types (such as for `@types/gulp-sass`). It is published
alongside every release of `sass` and `sass-embedded`, so you can always use the same version.
