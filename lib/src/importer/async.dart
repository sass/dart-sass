/// An interface for importers that resolves URLs in `@import`s to the contents
/// of Sass files.
///
/// Importers should override [toString] to provide a human-readable description
/// of the importer. For example, the default filesystem importer returns its
/// load path.
///
/// This class should only be extended by importers that *need* to do
/// asynchronous work. It's only compatible with the asynchronous `compile()`
/// methods. If an importer can work synchronously, it should extend [Importer]
/// instead.
///
/// Subclasses should extend [AsyncImporter], not implement it.
abstract class AsyncImporter {
  /// If [url] is recognized by this importer, returns its canonical format.
  ///
  /// Note that canonical URLs *must* be absolute, including a scheme. Returning
  /// `file:` URLs is encouraged if the imported stylesheet comes from a file on
  /// disk.
  ///
  /// If Sass has already loaded a stylesheet with the returned canonical URL,
  /// it re-uses the existing parse tree. This means that importers **must
  /// ensure** that the same canonical URL always refers to the same stylesheet,
  /// *even across different importers*.
  ///
  /// This may return `null` if [url] isn't recognized by this importer.
  ///
  /// If this importer's URL format supports file extensions, it should
  /// canonicalize them the same way as the default filesystem importer:
  ///
  /// * The importer should look for stylesheets by adding the prefix `_` to the
  ///   URL's basename, and by adding the extensions `.sass` and `.scss` if the
  ///   URL doesn't already have one of those extensions. For example, if the
  ///   URL was `foo/bar/baz`, the importer would look for:
  ///   * `foo/bar/baz.sass`
  ///   * `foo/bar/baz.scss`
  ///   * `foo/bar/_baz.sass`
  ///   * `foo/bar/_baz.scss`
  ///
  ///   If the URL was `foo/bar/baz.scss`, the importer would just look for:
  ///   * `foo/bar/baz.scss`
  ///   * `foo/bar/_baz.scss`
  ///
  ///   If the importer finds a stylesheet at more than one of these URLs, it
  ///   should throw an exception indicating that the import is ambiguous. Note
  ///   that if the extension is explicitly specified, a stylesheet with the
  ///   opposite extension may exist.
  ///
  /// * If none of the possible paths is valid, the importer should perform the
  ///   same resolution on the URL followed by `/index`. In the example above,
  ///   it would look for:
  ///   * `foo/bar/baz/_index.sass`
  ///   * `foo/bar/baz/index.sass`
  ///   * `foo/bar/baz/_index.scss`
  ///   * `foo/bar/baz/index.scss`
  ///
  ///   As above, if the importer finds a stylesheet at more than one of these
  ///   URLs, it should throw an exception indicating that the import is
  ///   ambiguous.
  ///
  /// If no stylesheets are found, the importer should return `null`.
  ///
  /// Calling [canonicalize] multiple times with the same URL must return the
  /// same result. Calling [canonicalize] with a URL returned by [canonicalize]
  /// must return that URL. Calling [canonicalize] with a URL relative to one
  /// returned by [canonicalize] must return a meaningful result.
  FutureOr<Uri> canonicalize(Uri url);

  /// Loads the Sass text for the given [url], or returns `null` if
  /// this importer can't find the stylesheet it refers to.
  ///
  /// The [url] comes from a call to [canonicalize] for this importer.
  ///
  /// When Sass encounters an `@import` rule in a stylesheet, it first calls
  /// [canonicalize] and [load] on the importer that first loaded that
  /// stylesheet with the imported URL resolved relative to the stylesheet's
  /// original URL. If either of those returns `null`, it then calls
  /// [canonicalize] and [load] on each importer in order with the URL as it
  /// appears in the `@import` rule.
  ///
  /// If the importer finds a stylesheet at [url] but it fails to load for some
  /// reason, or if [url] is uniquely associated with this importer but doesn't
  /// refer to a real stylesheet, the importer may throw an exception that will
  /// be wrapped by Sass. If the exception object has a `message` property, it
  /// will be used as the wrapped exception's message; otherwise, the exception
  /// object's `toString()` will be used. This means it's safe for importers to
  /// throw plain strings.
  FutureOr<ImporterResult> load(Uri url);

  /// Returns the time that the Sass file at [url] was last modified.
  ///
  /// The [url] comes from a call to [canonicalize] for this importer.
  ///
  /// By default, this returns the current time, indicating that [url] should be
  /// reloaded on every compilation. If implementations override this to provide
  /// a more accurate time, Sass will be better able to avoid recompiling it
  /// unnecessarily.
  ///
  /// If this throws an exception, the exception is ignored and the current time
  /// is used as the modification time.
