///
/// This isn't a normal [Importer] because Node Sass's import behavior isn't
/// compatible with Dart Sass's. In particular:
///
/// * Rather than doing URL resolution for relative imports, the importer is
///   passed the URL of the file that contains the import which it can then use
///   to do its own relative resolution. It's passed this even if that file was
///   imported by a different importer.
///
/// * Importers can return file paths rather than the contents of the imported
///   file. These paths are made absolute before they're included in
///   [EvaluateResult.includedFiles] or passed as the previous "URL" to other
///   importers.
///
/// * The working directory is always implicitly an include path.
///
/// * The order of import precedence is as follows:
///
///   1. Filesystem imports relative to the base file.
///   2. Filesystem imports relative to the working directory.
///   3. Filesystem imports relative to an `includePaths` path.
///   4. Custom importer imports.
